# awesome-genome-visualization

A list of interesting genome visualizers, genome browsers, or
genome-browser-like implementations

See the new companion website here
https://cmdcolin.github.io/awesome-genome-visualization/

Follow the BlueSky https://bsky.app/profile/awesomegenomeviz.bsky.social or
Mastodon account https://genomic.social/@awesomegenomevisualization

Note that the organization on the GitHub README here is a best effort
categorization using the first tag applied to each tool, but tools can have
multiple tags too. See the website to see all tags applied to tools

The general focus here is on tools that plot things in genomic or sequence
coordinate space

Note: This list runs the gammut from bespoke and simple to more general-purpose
and complex tools. Some are historical, or may be for more visual inspiration
only

I also encourage you to make your own visualization, things like R make this so
much easier! But also consider making your visualization code re-usable for the
wider community! And feel free to send PRs for more tools!
